CovidVaccinationBooking is a website designed to facilitate the process of Covid-19 vaccination bookings for two different user types: users and admins.


For users, the website offers a user-friendly interface to book vaccinations conveniently. By entering their pincode, users can easily find vaccination centers available within their area. The website provides information about the available dates and slots, allowing users to choose the most suitable option. Users also have the freedom to select their preferred vaccine choice from the available options.

Admins have access to a comprehensive dashboard where they can manage the system effectively. They have the authority to create, update, and delete vaccination centers as needed. Additionally, admins can manage the availability of medicines and allocate slots to ensure a smooth vaccination process. The dashboard also provides live stats, enabling admins to stay informed about the progress of vaccinations in real-time.
